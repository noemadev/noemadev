Developer. System builder.

Maintainer of Noema Protocol — an experimental system
for autonomous AI agents and composable intelligence.

No roadmap.
No promises.
Just work.

ABOUT
-----
This profile documents ongoing work on Noema Protocol
and related experimental systems.

The focus is on correctness, architecture, and execution,
not presentation.

NOEMA PROTOCOL
--------------
Noema is a low-level protocol for constructing intelligent
agents that can reason, act, and evolve across environments.

It prioritizes composability, determinism, and extensibility.

AREAS OF WORK
-------------
- autonomous agents
- agent runtimes
- cognitive systems
- memory layers
- execution pipelines
- onchain / offchain coordination

DESIGN NOTES
------------
- systems before features
- architecture over abstraction
- utility over visibility
- break things only when necessary

STATUS
------
active development
interfaces may change
no stability guarantees
